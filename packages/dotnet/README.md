# Nx Boat Tools - .Net

The "net" in the Nx Boat Tools toolbox. The `dotnet` plugin adds .Net project support to Nx but aims to do so in a very dotnet CLI familiar way. Currently, Nx Boat Tools can be used to build, package, publish, and clean .Net web APIs, console applications, and class libraries. It can also be used to run .Net web APIs and console applications for testing.

## Why not use [the community `nx-dotnet` plugin](https://github.com/nx-dotnet/nx-dotnet)?

The `nx-dotnet` plugin is a more mature plugin and definetly has its benefits. It supports test projects and specifying the language to use while Nx Boat Tools currently does not. It also supports any template type supported by the dotnet CLI but it does this by running `dotnet new` each time a project is created. Nx Boat Tools instead runs `dotnet new` as a base and can tweak and add onto the created files if needed. This files then get baked into a release to be used with the generators. We feel this is a better practice and also opens the door to some additional features we hope to add down the road.

## üí°¬†¬†How to install

```bash
npm install -D @nx-boat-tools/dotnet

# OR

yarn add -D @nx-boat-tools/dotnet
```

## üîñ¬†¬†Supported .Net Versions

The `dotnet` plugin currently generates projects using [.Net 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0). The dotnet executors use the .Net CLI and should work with any project using .NET Core 2.x or later.

## üèÉ¬†¬†Executors

### `run-dotnet-command`

The `run-dotnet-command` is the heart of all of the dotnet executors and is meant to reflect the underlying dotnet CLI. Its job is to take in the various parameters, form the CLI command to run, and then execute it.

#### Available options:

| name             | type          | default     | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `action`         | `string`      |             | Required. The underlying dotnet command to run. Supported values include: `build`, `pack`, `publish`, `run`, `clean`                                                                                                                                                            |
| `srcPath`        | `string`      |             | Required. The path to the `csproj` or `sln` file for the project                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `outputPath`     | `string`      |             | Required. This maps to the `output` param of the CLI command and is the path to where build output should be created                                                                                                                                                            |
| `updateVersion`  | `boolean`     | `true`      | Only used when `action` is `build`. See the "Versioning" section below for more details.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `runtimeID`      | `string?`     | `undefined` | This maps to the `runtime` param of the CLI command. For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the [RID catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog)                                                                                                  |
| `additionalArgs` | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is a string that is added to the end of the dotnet command and can be used for any available parameters that aren't explicitly defined in the executor options                                                                                                             |
| `configMap`      | `JsonObject?` | `undefined` | This is a json object used for mapping Nx configurations to values for the `configuration` param of the CLI command. The json key represents the Nx configuration and the value is expected to be a string representing the dotnet configuration to use. Ex: `{ dev: "Debug" }` |

#### Example:

Although the `run-dotnet-command` executor can be called directly, it's mostly intended to just be called from the other dotnet executors. Below is an example of this being done by the `clean` executor.

```typescript
//executor.ts

export default async function runExecutor(
  options: CleanDotnetExecutorSchema,
  context: ExecutorContext
) {
  const dotnetOptions: DotNetCommandExecutorSchema = {
    ...options,
    action: 'clean',
  };

  await runDotnetCommand(dotnetOptions, context);

  return {
    success: true,
  };
}
```

#### Versioning:

üöß¬†¬†This needs to be refactored¬†¬†üöß

Currently, when running with `action` set to `build` and `updateVersion` set to `true`, the `ReleaseVersion` and `PackageVersion` properties in the project's `csproj` file gets updated to what's in the `VERSION` file for the project located in the `outputPath`. This means that the `@nx-boat-tools/common:set-version` executor has to have executed before building a dotnet project when using the `updateVersion` flag.

Instead, we can have it pull the version from a `package.json` and generate one when generating all dotnet projects. We can then pull the `csproj` version update funtionality into its own `version` executor. To wrap it all up, we can add the community `semver` plugin to the generated projects and pass the `versionDotnet` target in the postTargets of the `version` target configuration.

### `build`

The `build` executor reflects calling the `dotnet build` command with the dotnet CLI. It builds a dotnet project or solution and all its dependencies. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build) for additional information on the underlying CLI command.

#### Available options:

| name             | type          | default     | description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `srcPath`        | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `srcPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)       |
| `outputPath`     | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `outputPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)    |
| `updateVersion`  | `boolean`     |             | Required. This is passed to the `updateVersion` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command) |
| `runtimeID`      | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `runtimeID` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |
| `additionalArgs` | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `additionalArgs` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)          |
| `configMap`      | `JsonObject?` | `undefined` | This is passed to the `configMap` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |

#### Example:

The following workspace configuration illustrates a possible dotnet `build` target for a given project.

```jsonc
//workspace.json

{
  //...
  "projects": {
    "example": {
      //...
      "targets": {
        "build": {
          "executor": "@nx-boat-tools/dotnet:build",
          "options": {
            "srcPath": "apps/example/example.sln",
            "outputPath": "dist/apps/example",
            "configMap": {
              "dev": "Debug",
              "prod": "Release"
            },
            "updateVersion": false
          },
          "configurations": {
            "dev": {},
            "prod": {
              "additionalArgs": "--nologo"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To build our dotnet project we just need to execute the `build` target...

```bash
nx build example
# OR
nx run example:build
```

Both of the above would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet build projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example
```

Here's another example but this time using a configuration...

```bash
nx run example:build:production
```

Which would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet build projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example --configuration Release --nologo
```

### `clean`

The `clean` executor reflects calling the `dotnet clean` command with the dotnet CLI. It cleans the output of a project or solution. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-clean) for additional information on the underlying CLI command.

#### Available options:

| name             | type          | default     | description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `srcPath`        | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `srcPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)       |
| `outputPath`     | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `outputPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)    |
| `updateVersion`  | `boolean`     |             | Required. This is passed to the `updateVersion` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command) |
| `runtimeID`      | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `runtimeID` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |
| `additionalArgs` | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `additionalArgs` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)          |
| `configMap`      | `JsonObject?` | `undefined` | This is passed to the `configMap` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |

#### Example:

The following workspace configuration illustrates a possible dotnet `clean` target for a given project.

```jsonc
//workspace.json

{
  //...
  "projects": {
    "example": {
      //...
      "targets": {
        "clean": {
          "executor": "@nx-boat-tools/dotnet:clean",
          "options": {
            "srcPath": "apps/example/example.sln",
            "outputPath": "dist/apps/example",
            "configMap": {
              "dev": "Debug",
              "prod": "Release"
            }
          },
          "configurations": {
            "dev": {},
            "prod": {
              "additionalArgs": "--nologo"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To perform a clean on our dotnet project we just need to execute the `clean` target...

```bash
nx clean example
# OR
nx run example:clean
```

Both of the above would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet clean projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example
```

Here's another example but this time using a configuration...

```bash
nx run example:clean:production
```

Which would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet clean projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example --configuration Release --nologo
```

### `package`

The `package` executor reflects calling the `dotnet pack` command with the dotnet CLI. It packages the project or solution into a NuGet package. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-pack) for additional information on the underlying CLI command.

#### üö©¬†¬†Note:

The `csproj` file(s) will be updated to set the `IsPackable` property to `true`. This will allow all project types to be packaged and not just `classlib` projects.

#### Available options:

| name             | type          | default     | description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `srcPath`        | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `srcPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)       |
| `outputPath`     | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `outputPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)    |
| `updateVersion`  | `boolean`     |             | Required. This is passed to the `updateVersion` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command) |
| `runtimeID`      | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `runtimeID` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |
| `additionalArgs` | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `additionalArgs` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)          |
| `configMap`      | `JsonObject?` | `undefined` | This is passed to the `configMap` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |

#### Example:

The following workspace configuration illustrates a possible dotnet `package` target for a given project.

```jsonc
//workspace.json

{
  //...
  "projects": {
    "example": {
      //...
      "targets": {
        "package": {
          "executor": "@nx-boat-tools/dotnet:package",
          "options": {
            "srcPath": "apps/example/example.sln",
            "outputPath": "dist/apps/example",
            "configMap": {
              "dev": "Debug",
              "prod": "Release"
            }
          },
          "configurations": {
            "dev": {},
            "prod": {
              "additionalArgs": "--nologo"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To package our dotnet project into a NuGet package we just need to execute the `package` target...

```bash
nx package example
# OR
nx run example:package
```

Both of the above would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet package projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example
```

Here's another example but this time using a configuration...

```bash
nx run example:package:production
```

Which would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet package projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example --configuration Release --nologo
```

### `publish`

The `publish` executor reflects calling the `dotnet publish` command with the dotnet CLI. It publishes the project and its dependencies to a folder for deployment. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) for additional information on the underlying CLI command.

#### Available options:

| name             | type          | default     | description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `srcPath`        | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `srcPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)       |
| `outputPath`     | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `outputPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)    |
| `updateVersion`  | `boolean`     |             | Required. This is passed to the `updateVersion` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command) |
| `runtimeID`      | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `runtimeID` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |
| `additionalArgs` | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `additionalArgs` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)          |
| `configMap`      | `JsonObject?` | `undefined` | This is passed to the `configMap` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |

#### Example:

The following workspace configuration illustrates a possible dotnet `publish` target for a given project.

```jsonc
//workspace.json

{
  //...
  "projects": {
    "example": {
      //...
      "targets": {
        "publish": {
          "executor": "@nx-boat-tools/dotnet:publish",
          "options": {
            "srcPath": "apps/example/example.sln",
            "outputPath": "dist/apps/example",
            "configMap": {
              "dev": "Debug",
              "prod": "Release"
            }
          },
          "configurations": {
            "dev": {},
            "prod": {
              "additionalArgs": "--nologo"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To get the dotnet project ready for deployment we just need to execute the `publish` target...

```bash
nx publish example
# OR
nx run example:publish
```

Both of the above would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet publish projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example
```

Here's another example but this time using a configuration...

```bash
nx run example:publish:production
```

Which would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet publish projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example --configuration Release --nologo
```

### `run`

The `run` executor reflects calling the `dotnet run` command with the dotnet CLI. It runs a project without doing any compliling, etc. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run) for additional information on the underlying CLI command.

#### Available options:

| name             | type          | default     | description                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `srcPath`        | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `srcPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)       |
| `outputPath`     | `string`      |             | Required. This is passed to the `outputPath` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)    |
| `updateVersion`  | `boolean`     |             | Required. This is passed to the `updateVersion` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command) |
| `runtimeID`      | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `runtimeID` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |
| `additionalArgs` | `string?`     | `undefined` | This is passed to the `additionalArgs` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)          |
| `configMap`      | `JsonObject?` | `undefined` | This is passed to the `configMap` option of the underlying [`run-dotnet-command` executor](#run-dotnet-command)               |

#### Example:

The following workspace configuration illustrates a possible dotnet `run` target for a given project.

```jsonc
//workspace.json

{
  //...
  "projects": {
    "example": {
      //...
      "targets": {
        "run": {
          "executor": "@nx-boat-tools/dotnet:run",
          "options": {
            "srcPath": "apps/example/example.sln",
            "outputPath": "dist/apps/example",
            "configMap": {
              "dev": "Debug",
              "prod": "Release"
            }
          },
          "configurations": {
            "dev": {},
            "prod": {
              "additionalArgs": "--nologo"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To run our dotnet project we just need to execute the `run` target...

```bash
nx run example
# OR
nx run example:run
```

Both of the above would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet run projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example
```

Here's another example but this time using a configuration...

```bash
nx run example:run:production
```

Which would run the following dotnet CLI command

```bash
dotnet run projectRoot/apps/example/example.sln --output projectRoot/dist/apps/example --configuration Release --nologo
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è¬†¬†Generators

### `project`

The `project` generator is the heart of all of the dotnet generators. Its job is to take in the various parameters, create the project files based on the corresponding template, and add the project to the `workspace.json` will all the appropriate dotnet targets for the dotnet project type.

#### Available options:

| name               | type      | default     | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`             | `string`  |             | Required. The name of the dotnet project that's being created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `tags`             | `string?` | `undefined` | Tags to be used when adding the project to the `workspace.json`. More information about tags can be found [here](https://nx.dev/l/a/structure/monorepo-tags)                                                                                                                                             |
| `directory`        | `string?` | `undefined` | This can be used to nest the project into additional folders inside of the `apps` or `libs` folder. Insead of going to `apps/{projectName}`, for example, the project can be created at `apps/{directoryValue}/{projectName}`                                                                            |
| `projectType`      | `string`  |             | This identifies what type of project to create. The values should be the same values as what's passed to the [`TEMPLATE` argument](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new#arguments) of the `dotnet new` command. Currently supported values are: `classlib`, `console`, `webapi` |
| `pathPrefix`       | `string?` | `undefined` | This doesn't appear to be used and can be removed¬†¬†üöß                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `simpleModuleName` | `boolean` | `undefined` | üöß¬†¬†This doesn't appear to be used and can be removed¬†¬†üöß                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `ownSolution`      | `boolean` | `false`     | When set to `true`, the project will have its own solution file which will be in the project directory. When set to `false`, it will be added to a solution file at the workspace root.                                                                                                                  |

#### Generated files:

What files are generated depend on the `projectType` that's specified but should mostly reflect the same files you'd get from running `dotnet new {projectType}`. The biggest difference is whether or not the solution file is created or if another one is appended to.

#### Updates to `workspace.json`:

The project is added to the `workspace.json` with the following high-level targets defined:

- `build` - This is a `chain-execute` which calls the following targets:
  - `version` - üöß¬†¬†This is the common `version` executor but needs to be refactored üöß
  - `buildDotnet` - This runs the dotnet `build` executor for the project
  - `package` - For the `prod` condiguration only, this runs the dotnet `package` executor
- `clean` - this calls the dotnet `clean` executor to clean up build output
- `run` - this calls the dotnet `run` target to run the application

üö©¬†¬†Note: The `run` target is not added when `classlib` is specified for `projectType`

The following is a full example of what's added to the `workspace.json` for a dotnet project, in this case for a `projectType` of `console`:

```jsonc

### `classlib`

Creates a dotnet class library project.

#### Available options:

| name          | type      | default     | description                                                                                     |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | `string`  |             | Required. This is passed to the `name` option of the underlying [`project` generator](#project) |
| `tags`        | `string?` | `undefined` | This is passed to the `tags` option of the underlying [`project` generator](#project)           |
| `directory`   | `string?` | `undefined` | This is passed to the `directory` option of the underlying [`project` generator](#project)      |
| `ownSolution` | `boolean` | `false`     | This is passed to the `ownSolution` option of the underlying [`project` generator](#project)    |

#### Generated files:

The generated files should mostly reflect the same files you'd get from running `dotnet new classlib`. The biggest difference is whether or not the solution file is created or if another one is appended to. The project directory for `classlib` projects will be under the `libs` folder in the workspace.

#### Creating a `classlib` project

The following illustrates how to add a dotnet `classlib` project with various options:

```bash
#Create a project named my-classlib in libs/my-classlib and adds it to the workspace.sln
nx g @nx-dev-tools/dotnet:classlib my-classlib

#Create a project named my-classlib in libs/my-classlib with the solution at libs/my-classlib/MyClasslib.sln
nx g @nx-dev-tools/dotnet:classlib my-classlib --ownSolution=true
